# ring-sim
An attempt at creating a 'simple' toolkit for simulating the gravitational dynamics of a planetary ring system, including moons.

Moon_mesh_tools.py contains the core modules/functions behind how the code works, a second file should be used to assemble a simulation and run it. My current working example has saturn, and 3 of its moons.
